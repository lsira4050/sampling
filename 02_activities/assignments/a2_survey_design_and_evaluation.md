# Assignment: Questionnaire Design and Sample Evaluation

## Requirements

The goal of this assignment is to practice developing and evaluating sampling materials.

### Part A - Survey Design:

Select one of the scenarios below and design a survey to meet the need(s) outlined in the prompt.

1.	In two to three sentences, describe the purpose of your survey
2.	Describe your target population, sampling frame, sampling units, and overall sampling strategy.
3.	Write a 5-10 question survey to address your chosen scenario below.

##### Scenarios
1.	You work in the Human Resources Department at a large tech company. Over the past few months, the company has been experiencing a high turnover rate across many of its departments, specifically within the entry- and lower-level positions. The company wishes to understand why this turnover is happening, and what changes need to occur to improve employee satisfaction.
2.	You work for a Canadian national political party during a federal election. Throughout the campaign period, your party has seen relatively high approval ratings, but an opposing party is also polling favorably and may still have a chance to win the election. You are one month away from the election and you want to understand what voters want from your party and its leader in order to maintain your lead and eventually win the election.
3.	You are a student researcher in the sociology department at the University of Toronto. You are working on a research project that concerns the relationship between music taste and age. This involves both comparisons between different people of different ages and comparisons of the same individual at different ages during their lifetime. You wish to understand to what extent age influences music taste, specifically as it relates to perceptions of popular music. Your results will be written into an academic paper that you hope to publish.

### Part B - Survey Evaluation:

For the **Canadian General Social Survey on Giving, Volunteering, and Participating, 2018 (cycle 33)**, conducted by Statistics Canada find any and all available documentation for the data gathered and identify and describe the survey features indicated below.

1. Sample type
2. Sample size
3. Target population
4. Sampling frame
5. Survey mode(s) 
6. Timeline
7. Response rate
8. Weights
9. Data processing
10. Cleaning, imputation, etc
11. Sources of error
12. Limitations, known biases, etc
13. Link to documentation and any additional sources used


# Your Changes

## Part A - Survey Design: 

The number of your chosen topic: `2`

Describe the purpose of your survey:
```
This survey aims to identify key policy priorities and leadership qualities that potential voters value most with one month remaining before the federal election. The results will help our political party refine messaging, prioritize campaign issues, and highlight leadership strengths to maintain our lead and secure victory in the upcoming election.
```

Describe your target population, sampling frame, sampling units, and observational units:
```
Target population: Canadian citizens eligible to vote in the upcoming federal election.
Sampling frame: Registered voter lists supplemented with random-digit dialing to reach cell-phone-only households.
Sampling units: Individual eligible voters across all Canadian provinces and territories.
Sampling strategy: Stratified random sampling with strata based on geographic regions (provinces/territories) and population density (urban/rural), with additional quota sampling to ensure adequate representation across age groups, gender, and ethnicity that matches the Canadian electorate. Oversampling will be conducted in highly competitive electoral districts.```

## Part B - Survey Evaluation:

Identify and describe survey features:

```
1. Sample type: The survey used a multi-stage stratified sampling design. The sample was drawn from respondents who completed the 2016, 2017, and 2018 iterations of the Labour Force Survey (LFS), creating a complex probability sample.

2. Sample size: The final sample size was 16,149 respondents.

3. Target population: The target population included all persons 15 years of age and over living in Canada's ten provinces, excluding full-time residents of institutions and persons living on reserves.

4. Sampling frame: The sampling frame was derived from the Labour Force Survey (LFS) sample, which uses an area frame and a list frame. The frame consisted of households that had recently completed their participation in the LFS, specifically those from 2016, 2017, and 2018 LFS sample rotations.

5. Survey mode(s): Data was collected through computer-assisted telephone interviewing (CATI) and electronic questionnaires (EQ).

6. Timeline: Data collection occurred over a period of approximately 4 months from September 2018 to December 2018.

7. Response rate: The overall response rate was 53.1%.

8. Weights: The survey data included survey weights to account for unequal probabilities of selection and to adjust for non-response. The weighting process involved several adjustments including household-level and person-level adjustments to ensure the sample accurately represented the target population.

9. Data processing: Data underwent extensive processing including verification of skip patterns, coding of "other-specify" responses, and derivation of composite variables based on multiple questions. Industry and occupation responses were coded using standard Statistics Canada classifications.

10. Cleaning, imputation, etc.: The dataset underwent consistent editing to identify and resolve errors, outliers, and inconsistencies. Missing data for key variables underwent imputation to reduce potential biases, with different imputation methods used depending on the nature of the data.

11. Sources of error: The survey is subject to both sampling and non-sampling errors. Sampling errors arise because inferences about the population are based on sample data. Non-sampling errors include coverage errors (under-representation of certain groups), measurement errors (respondent misunderstanding questions), non-response bias, and processing errors.

12. Limitations, known biases, etc.: Known limitations include:
    - Exclusion of territories and institutional populations
    - Potential recall bias for retrospective questions about volunteering and giving
    - Social desirability bias (respondents may overreport socially desirable behaviors)
    - Under-representation of certain demographic groups, particularly younger adults
    - The volunteer rate estimate may be affected by methodology changes compared to previous cycles
